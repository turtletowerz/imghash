What do I name this?

The primary objective of this project is to assess the viability of Difference Hashes (DHash) for images in reverse image recognition, and pontentially compare it to other, more vetted formats such as Average and Perceptual Hashes. The basic outline for DHashes can be found [here](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html).


TODOs
- Create a more concrete README, with a better outline of the file format as well as the rationale behind the project
- Add tests for hashes, reading and writing of files (maybe the tree too?)
- Turn the cmd/main.go file into a usable
- Make the log file actually do something
